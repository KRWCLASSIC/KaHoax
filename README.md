# KaHoax `1.1.2`

This is a Kahoot cheat made for browsers and Tampermonkey.

## Instructions (Website)

1. Go to [this website](https://kahoax.krwclassic.com) and use!

> Nginx configuration I used for this website is available under [nginx-config.md](https://github.com/KRWCLASSIC/KaHoax/blob/main/nginx-config.md) file.

## Instructions (Manual)

1. Open the KaHoax.user.js

2. Click raw to install this script to Tampermonkey or copy-paste it on the console. Ctrl+Shift+i opens the developer tab and there you can find the console. Paste the code the code there and press enter to run it.

3. Type in the quiz ID. You should see it on the host's screen. If the quiz ID box is still red after typing in the right quiz ID that means the Kahoot is private and this cannot be used with it.

## Features

The latest version includes Auto Answer, Show Answers and Quiz search based on John Weeky API and upgraded by me. Only quiz and multi-select answers are supported. Type answers etc. are not supported. You can drag the menu from the top bar and minimize and close if you want. Closing the cheat will end the script and will stop everything it was made to. You can use this as a panic button.
